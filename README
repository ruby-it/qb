This code has not been touched in 5 years or something. 
Even 5 years ago I don't remember why it was touched.
It is kind of self contained, and the schema.rb I regenerated recently, using db/qb.sql as template.

AFAICT 4 tests are failing and I have no clue on why, but I am going to blame one of them on ruby 1.8, the other are probably just stuff i never updated after a live hack on code running in production while I was in erasmus sorry :)
