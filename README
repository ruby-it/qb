== i2: Instiki went slim

i2 is small, tight rewrite of Instiki as a native Rails application that runs of a database instead of Madeleine.
It's better suited for big, public wikis with lots of pages. But it requires more manual work to set up.

=== Features

* Page caching: Once a page has been viewed, it's cached so only the web server needs to process it

* Multiple books: The same installation can host multiple books (separate wikis with their own namespace)


=== Dependencies

* RedCloth: Use 3.0.3 as 3.0.4 is buggy.


=== Getting Started

1. Edit database.yml (feel free to use sqlite or pgsql)

2. Create the matching database

3. Run "rake migrate" (will create all the tables)

4. Create your first book through the console:

     Book.create :name => "My Nice Wiki", :url_name => "wiki"
