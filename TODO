/ sidestepped

(top priority )

 
- duplicated entries for authors, check
- add backlinks
- need more tests for revision_controller
- 100% test coverage 
- add top bar with links to add items, wiki, rss, all pages etc and remove submenu from wiki
- multilanguage syntax highlight via <pre lang=foo>. Need syntax tokenizers, too. 
- Revision#excerpt is pretty dummy, try to find something better
- QbCloth uses ugly hacks, find some better solutions
- login_controller is a mess. Can we clean it up (we need tests for that!) ?
- add "wiki reflection" system. I.e. find all foo such that "blog: foo" in specified pages
- add "new page" insertion form
- fix css for home (replace -moz-border-radius with images)
- change question in something meaningful
- fix dumpall to avoid duplicated info (i.e. current revisions are already in Pages)
- do we need nlink_to? If not remove completely 
- cleanup useless CSS stuff 
- rename css to qb.css 
- use in-place-editor for wiki (investigate accessibility and interaction with login) 
- remove useless helpers
- add ping to google sitemap
- add ping to technorati
- add pings to whatever, is just a for loop :) 
- write reimport system for yaml metadata from dumpall

(least priority )

SIDESTEPPED
/ add tags (and put them as meta keywords )
/ can delete home controller completely, massive conceptual simplification?
/ check query to dbms (use piggyback)
/ handle big images in the home (now they mess up the layout on low resolution
